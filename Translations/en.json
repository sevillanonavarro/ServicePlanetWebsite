  "customer_returns.brief_intro": "As a leading online retailer, we are required by distance selling laws to accept a high volume of product returns within the statutory trial period. Many of these returned devices are barely used, but GDPR guidelines for data on storage media, visible signs of use, and damaged packaging have traditionally forced us to sell these products to bulk buyers. This approach offered little control over data erasure and resulted in significant write-downs on products with already tight margins.",
  "customer_returns.extended_use_case.customer": "Online retailer (B2C/B2B2C)",
  "customer_returns.extended_use_case.problem": "Due to the legal right of withdrawal for online purchases, we process a continuous stream of returns—most of which are nearly new devices. However, GDPR regulations require secure data wiping from all storage media, and many returned products show minor usage marks or have damaged packaging. Historically, these products were sold in bulk to third-party buyers, but this created several challenges: we had no guarantee that customer data was properly erased, exposing us to compliance risks, and the resale value was low due to lack of quality control. The result was a significant cost burden and loss of potential margin, as well as a lack of transparency and traceability in the returns process.",
  "customer_returns.extended_use_case.solution": "Service Planet, with its Melissan ERP system, has enabled us to completely transform our returns process. Returned devices are now individually assessed: undamaged products are fully refurbished to “like new” condition, while those with minor defects are restored to maximize residual value at a manageable cost. Using advanced tools, Service Planet efficiently tests and wipes devices with Cyric, and also handles repackaging, labeling, and the production of protective materials. Every step is traceable, ensuring strict GDPR compliance and allowing us to monitor if any devices are returned again in the future.

  "doa_handling.brief_intro": "With the rise of online resellers and easy return policies, the number of products returned to vendors as Dead On Arrival (DOA) has increased sharply. However, the proportion of computers and monitors that are actually defective and qualify for DOA reimbursement has dropped significantly, leading to high costs and inefficiencies for vendors.",
  "doa_handling.extended_use_case.customer": "Major vendor (B2B)",
  "doa_handling.extended_use_case.problem": "Online resellers benefit from generous return periods and simple return logistics, resulting in a surge of products sent back as DOA within 30 days of sale. In reality, only a small fraction of these returns are truly defective and meet the vendor’s DOA criteria. This has led to a heavily contaminated return stream, with vendors facing unnecessary costs for processing, logistics, and lost product value. Previously, many resellers used the DOA process as a quick way to recover funds, further increasing the volume of non-defective returns and administrative workload.",
  "doa_handling.extended_use_case.solution": "Service Planet has implemented a local DOA check in the Benelux to address this challenge. Every returned product is thoroughly tested and physically as well as administratively verified before being accepted as a true DOA. If a hardware defect is confirmed, the product is processed, and an RMA is requested from the vendor, resulting in a credit for the reseller. If the product is not defective or does not meet DOA guidelines, it is refurbished by Service Planet—securely wiped, cleaned, tested, and repackaged—and returned to the reseller for resale. This process has led to significant cost savings for the vendor by preventing the acceptance of fully functional products as DOA. Now, around 60% of returned products are refurbished and sent back, causing resellers to reconsider before submitting a DOA claim. If the DOA is valid, Service Planet will manage the claim and financial handling with all resellers for the vendor. The number of DOA requests has dropped substantially, and the vendor benefits from lower costs, improved process control, and a more sustainable approach to returns.",

Devices are personally owned, so the burden of repair, data security, and downtime falls on the student. Schools expect students to remain digitally connected, but students and their families rarely have the resources, expertise, or logistical network to manage efficient repairs, loan devices, or secure data handling.

While this was sufficient to confirm the device powered on, it did not include a full hardware test, stress test, or a fresh installation of the operating system. As a result, many computers were returned to customers with unresolved or new technical issues—sometimes the original fault persisted, sometimes a new issue had been introduced during repair, or the customer perceived a problem due to software left unchanged. Additionally, devices were not always fully cleaned or physically inspected, leading to negative perceptions of quality.

  "pc_ready.extended_use_case.problem": "When customers purchase new computers from a major electronics retailer, they often encounter a slow and sometimes confusing setup process at home. Devices may arrive with outdated software, unnecessary trial programs, or in the wrong language, requiring extra effort before they can be used. This leads to frustration, increased support calls, and a less favorable first impression of both the device and the retailer. Inconsistent preparation can also result in devices that are not fully tested, increasing the risk of defects or dead-on-arrival products. For the retailer, this means missed opportunities to add value through pre-installed services or branded experiences, and a lost chance to keep the end user within their own ecosystem.",

Each computer is updated with the latest software, all essential drivers, and the customer’s language and retailer branding before it leaves the warehouse. Shortcuts to the retailer’s online store and pre-installed retailer software—including cloud solutions—keep the retailer top of mind and foster ongoing engagement. All devices are fully tested, GDPR-compliant, and delivered clean, safe, and ready for immediate use, eliminating dead-on-arrival risk and ensuring a secure, up-to-date experience.

  "printer_pack.extended_use_case.problem": "Despite strong demand for ink subscriptions, many customers fail to complete the registration process after purchasing a new printer. The process is often perceived as too complicated or is abandoned due to technical installation issues, resulting in a low conversion rate from subscription purchase to active use. This not only frustrates customers—who miss out on the convenience of always having ink—but also limits recurring revenue opportunities for both the vendor and the retailer. Additionally, support teams are burdened with questions about setup, registration, and technical issues, while missed activations mean customers are less likely to remain loyal.",
  "printer_pack.extended_use_case.solution": "Service Planet has redesigned the process to remove these barriers. With the Printer Pack service, each printer is delivered pre-registered for instant ink and includes a two-step free ink credit incentive: customers receive an initial print credit at setup, and a second credit after contacting Service Planet’s first-line support center. This motivates customers to call, where trained agents can guide them through registration, help select the right subscription, and provide remote support for any installation or technical problems. As a result, conversion rates to active subscriptions have increased significantly. Customers enjoy seamless printing and the benefits of a managed ink subscription, while both retailer and vendor benefit from higher subscription activation, increased loyalty, and improved customer satisfaction.",

  "services.melissan_in_store_module.extended_intro": "Welcome to Melissan’s In-Store Module, the frontline solution for managing repairs, returns, and customer interactions in retail environments. Designed for technical desks, this module allows staff to intake devices, generate pre-authorization tickets, and capture digital signatures—all within minutes. If a repair exceeds in-store capabilities (e.g., complex hardware issues), the system automatically routes the item to pre-approved external partners, with shipping labels and tracking updates synced to Melissan’s central portal. Upon return, the module verifies the product’s condition against initial intake records, flagging discrepancies like new scratches, missing accessories, or incomplete repairs. Technicians can then issue partial refunds, order replacement parts, or escalate cases, all while maintaining a GDPR-compliant audit trail. With real-time dashboards, retailers gain visibility into repair timelines, outsourcing costs, and customer satisfaction metrics, ensuring agility in fast-paced retail workflows.",

  "smart_home_installation.brief_intro": "Retailers selling smart home hardware to consumers and small business users often face high return rates and customer frustration due to the complexity of installation and integration. Professional setup is essential to ensure devices like smart doorbells, thermostats, sensors, cameras, and lighting work seamlessly together.",
  "smart_home_installation.extended_use_case.customer": "Retailers (B2C/B2B2C)",
  "smart_home_installation.extended_use_case.problem": "The growing smart home market offers retailers significant sales opportunities, but also presents challenges. Many consumers struggle with installing and configuring devices that use different standards such as Matter, Z-Wave, or Zigbee. Products are often returned because they are too complex to set up, don’t work as advertised, or cannot be integrated with other devices in the home. This leads to lost sales, high return costs, and dissatisfied customers. Retailers need a solution that not only reduces returns but also ensures customers can fully benefit from the smart home ecosystem—whether built around Apple, Google, or Amazon platforms.",
  "smart_home_installation.extended_use_case.solution": "Service Planet provides a specialized Smart Home Installation service with experienced engineers who handle the complete setup and configuration of all smart home devices at the customer’s location. This includes network configuration, device pairing, integration of different brands, security settings, and a basic user tutorial. The engineer ensures that all devices work together—such as connecting a doorbell to a smart display or enabling voice-controlled lighting—so the customer enjoys a fully functional smart home without technical headaches. For the retailer, this means higher customer satisfaction, fewer returns, and increased sales as customers gain confidence to expand their smart home setup over time.",

  "outsourcing_onsite_repair_services.brief_intro": "As a major online retailer, we manage a wide range of repair and return flows for products from multiple brands using Service Planet’s Melissan ERP system. To ensure efficient, uniform, and data-driven service for all product categories—from HP computers to Miele and Bosch appliances—we rely on a single platform and process. Every extra day a customer waits for repair is one too many.",
  "outsourcing_onsite_repair_services.extended_use_case.customer": "Large online retailer (B2B)",
  "outsourcing_onsite_repair_services.extended_use_case.problem": "With an extensive assortment of brands and product types, managing onsite repairs is a complex challenge. Each manufacturer has its own service policy, RMA process, and authorized partners, making it difficult to provide consistent, fast, and transparent customer support. For example, HP computers are repaired under HP authorization in Service Planet’s depot, while for white goods like Miele and Bosch, different external service partners are required. This fragmentation leads to administrative overhead, delays, uncertainty about warranty coverage and costs, and inconsistent communication with customers. As a retailer, we need a uniform, automated process that provides clear status updates, customer satisfaction tracking, and seamless integration with our own systems—regardless of the product or brand.",
  "outsourcing_onsite_repair_services.extended_use_case.solution": "Service Planet’s Melissan platform enables us to control and automate all repair and return flows through a single API-driven system. For onsite repairs, Melissan offers a dedicated workflow that allows us to outsource, monitor, and complete repairs with third-party partners within one unified framework. Service Planet acts as the central service manager: from intake and routing to the right external partner, to follow-up, status control, and final completion—all managed within Melissan. Any exceptions, such as quotations or special cases, are handled by Service Planet’s Contact Center, which supports both automation and AI-assisted human service where needed. This approach gives us one point of contact for all repairs, ensures consistent service quality, and provides real-time feedback on status and customer satisfaction, significantly reducing complexity and improving the customer experience.",

  "onsite_tv_repair.brief_intro": "A leading consumer electronics manufacturer uses Service Planet’s onsite repair service to repair large, wall-mounted televisions at customers’ homes or offices. The challenges include logistical complexities and risks of damage during dismantling or transport.",
  "onsite_tv_repair.extended_use_case.customer": "Major OEM manufacturer (B2B & B2C).",
  "onsite_tv_repair.extended_use_case.problem": "Modern televisions have become increasingly large, delicate, and are often permanently installed with integrated cabling and wall mounting. When a defect occurs, customers cannot simply return these devices to the store without facing a high risk of damage or the need for complex dismantling. This situation results in elevated transport costs for returns, frequent customer complaints about extended downtime—since the television is often a central feature in homes and offices—and reputational damage when products are harmed during transit.",
  "onsite_tv_repair.extended_use_case.solution": "Service Planet addresses these challenges by performing all repairs onsite through a streamlined and professional process. When a customer reports a defect via the OEM portal, a case is automatically created in Melissan with all relevant details, such as the TV model, serial number, and installation specifics. The Melissan platform then determines exactly which parts, tools, and engineer expertise are required for the repair, ensuring the right resources are dispatched. Customers are kept informed at every stage, receiving an automatic scheduling email with information about the assigned engineer, their credentials, and the planned time slot, followed by a reminder email 24 hours before the appointment with practical preparation tips. The engineer arrives on site with OEM-approved parts and specialized tools, performing the repair directly at the customer’s location without the need to dismantle the TV. Once the repair is complete, the engineer closes the case in Melissan and requests a digital signature for approval. The customer then automatically receives an NPS survey to provide feedback on the service experience.",

  "drone_depot_external_repair.brief_intro": "An online retailer sends returned drones to Service Planet for assessment and repair management. Service Planet does not repair the drones itself but acts as a central depot, efficiently triaging each case before any further action is taken.",
  "drone_depot_external_repair.extended_use_case.customer": "Online retailer (B2C/B2B2C)",
  "drone_depot_external_repair.extended_use_case.problem": "As hybrid and remote working become the norm, demand for reliable, ready-to-use video conferencing spaces has surged. Business clients expect seamless installation, professional configuration, and immediate usability for brands like Logitech, GN/Jabra, and Poly. However, the reseller does not have its own field service operation or the specialized software needed to manage onsite installations at scale. This makes it challenging to ensure consistent quality, efficient scheduling, and transparent project management, especially across international clients with diverse technical requirements.",
  "drone_depot_external_repair.extended_use_case.solution": "Service Planet receives all returned drones at its depot and uses its Melissan ERP system to standardize the intake and triage process. Each drone is diagnosed to determine whether the issue is a software or control problem, a hardware defect within warranty, or a hardware problem outside warranty. Software and control issues are resolved by Service Planet directly, providing fast turnaround and customer support. Hardware defects that qualify for warranty are outsourced to the manufacturer or an authorized partner, ensuring proper handling and cost control. Drones with hardware damage outside warranty—such as those crashed by the user—are returned unrepaired to the end user, avoiding unnecessary repair costs. This process reduces costs for the retailer, streamlines communication, and ensures that only valid warranty claims are escalated, while customers receive clear feedback and faster resolutions",

  "onsite_installation_configure_video.extended_use_case.solution": "Service Planet acts as an extension of the reseller, providing certified engineers and a proven process for onsite installation and configuration of meeting rooms. Orders are automatically transferred via a data integration into the Melissan ERP system, which triggers workflows for order review, preparation, scheduling, and confirmation. Service Planet’s engineers, trained in leading brands, handle the entire installation process: mounting hardware, configuring devices, connecting peripherals, and thoroughly testing video and audio quality.

  "rma_handling.brief_intro": "As a retailer, managing external repairs for defective equipment from various brands can be complex and inefficient. Service Planet’s depot acts as a central hub, outsourcing repairs to trusted third parties and providing a single, streamlined process for all your RMA needs.",
  "rma_handling.extended_use_case.customer": "Retailer (B2B)",
  "rma_handling.extended_use_case.problem": "Retailers often face the challenge of dealing with multiple external repair partners, each with their own processes, requirements, and communication channels. This fragmentation means managing RMAs can quickly become an administrative burden—one partner requires an RMA number, another needs troubleshooting first, some have a portal and others do not. The result is lost time, inconsistent customer experiences, and unnecessary complexity for both staff and end customers. Retailers want a unified, efficient process that allows them to manage all external repairs through a single system and point of contact, with clear status updates and reliable turnaround times.",
  "rma_handling.extended_use_case.solution": "Service Planet, through its depot and Melissan ERP application, acts as a beacon for the retailer, centralizing and standardizing the entire external repair process. All defective equipment is registered and tracked via a single API, regardless of the brand or partner involved. Service Planet coordinates the outsourcing, follow-up, quality control, and completion of each repair within a unified workflow. Retailers no longer need to contact ten different parties or manage ten different processes; everything is handled through one platform with consistent communication and clear accountability. The Contact Center of Service Planet manages any exceptions, quotations, or special cases, combining automation where possible with AI-assisted human support where necessary. This results in a much easier, more efficient process for the retailer and a better customer experience overall.",

  "test_orders.brief_intro": "A major online marketplace seller operates in a highly competitive environment where fraudulent listings and counterfeit products are occuring, threatening customer trust and the value of their brand.",
  "test_orders.extended_use_case.customer": "Online marketplace seller (B2B)",
  "test_orders.extended_use_case.problem": "Large online resellers have invested heavily in building their brand and generating significant website traffic. To leverage this, many have launched their own marketplaces, allowing third-party sellers to offer goods on their platform and benefit from the reseller’s reputation and reach. However, this opens the door to third parties engaging in illegal or unethical practices—such as selling counterfeit products, misrepresenting goods, or failing to deliver as promised. These issues can lead to customer complaints, legal risks, and reputational damage for the marketplace owner.",
  "test_orders.extended_use_case.solution": "Service Planet provides a robust product validation service using a structured workflow in the Melissan platform. Products from third-party vendors are independently ordered and sent to a professional testing facility, where they are assessed for authenticity, functionality, safety, and compliance with legal and manufacturer requirements. The process also verifies that the product matches its online description and images, and checks packaging and delivery as promised. Detailed reports highlight any discrepancies or risks, enabling the marketplace seller to make informed decisions—accepting, rejecting, or flagging products as needed. This approach minimizes business risk, protects the brand, and ensures only compliant, safe, and accurately described products reach customers.",
